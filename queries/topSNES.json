    "summary": "Dungeon Master established several new standards for role playing and computer games in general. Dungeon Master was a realtime game instead of the traditional turn-based approach that was prevalent until then. Instead of using text-based commands to interact with the environment, players directly manipulated objects and the environment by clicking the mouse in the enlarged first-person view. \n \nAbstract Dungeons and Dragons style experience points and levels were eschewed in favor of a system where the characters\u0027 skills were improved directly via using them. It also introduced some novel control methods including the spell casting system, which involved learning sequences of runes which represented the form and function of a spell\u0027s effect. For example, a fireball spell was created by mixing the fire symbol with the wing symbol. This kind of attention to detail and focus on the user interface was typical of the game and helped create an often captivating sense of craft and ingenuity. Other factors in immersiveness were the then-revolutionary use of sound effects to indicate when a creature was nearby, and (primitive) dynamic lighting.",

He touches a mysterious box which freezes up all citizens in the village. By conquering towers in the under world, Ark unfreezes the village people little by little and incidentially resurrects the continents in the destroyed upper world. Hereupon, the Elder of the village instructs him to visit the upper world and resurrect the life.\n\nIn the second chapter \"Ressurrection of the World\", Ark ressurects all plants in the world making it possible to cross the mountains of Guiana. In the second step he reanimates all the birds, the wind, animals and most recently, the humans.\n\nIn the third chapter \"Resurrection of the Genius\", the elder of the village appears in Arks dream telling him to support humankind in making progress. Ark travels from city to city and helps in cities growth and the development of technologies. But he also resurrects Beruga, a scientist who put himself into a sleep state back when when earth was destroyed. He has a vision of a perfect world in which most people get killed by a virus and only a few people live on the world by being turned into immortal zombies. The elder appears again, telling Ark that his work is done and he can die now. Ark realizes now he as human from the darkside has been used by Dark Gaia for his plans over world\u0027s domination. Kumari, a wise man teleports Ark away and tells him to search for five starstones to call the golden child. Ark meets his Lightside self who kills the darkside Ark.\n\nIn the fourth and last chapter \"Ressurection of the Hero\", Ark will be reborn as a baby through Light Gaia.

    "storyline": "Like the original Test Drive, the focus of The Duel is driving exotic cars through dangerous highways, evading traffic, and trying to escape police pursuits. While the first game in the series had the player simply racing for time in a single scenario, Test Drive II improves upon its predecessor by introducing varied scenery, and giving the player the option of racing against the clock or competing against a computer-controlled opponent. \n \nThe player initially is given the opportunity to choose a car to drive and a level of difficulty, which in turn determines whether the car will use an automatic or manual transmission—the number of difficulty options varies between gaming platforms. Levels begin with the player’s car (and the computer opponent, if selected) idling on a roadway. Primarily these are two to four lane public highways with many turns; each level is different, and they include obstacles such as bridges, cliffs, and tunnels in addition to the other cars already on the road. Each level also has one or more police cars along the course. \n \nThe goal of each level is to reach the gas station at the end of the course in the least amount of time. Stopping at the gas station is not mandatory, and one could drive past it if inattentive. The consequence of not stopping results in running out of gas, and thus losing a car (life). The player begins the game with 5 lives, one of which is lost each time that the player crashes into something. If the player completes a level without crashing or running out of gas, then he or she is awarded a bonus life. In addition to losing a life, crashing adds thirty seconds to the player\u0027s time. Cars could crash into other traffic or off-road obstacles such as trees; they could crash by falling off the cliff on one of the mountain levels, or they could sustain too much damage by staying off the roadway for too long on the flatland levels. Players could also lose a life when using a manual transmission by redlining and consequently blowing the engine. Crashing into a police car instantly ends the game, regardless of the number of lives the player has left. \n \nPolice cars appear in every level, and if the player is driving faster than the speed limit when encountering one of them, the police car will follow in pursuit. If at any point while being pursued the police car is able to pass the player’s car, the player is forced to pull over and receives a ticket stating the offense and the speed of the vehicle. While this doesn’t cost the player a life, it does take away valuable time. Players can avoid being pursued by police by slowing down before encountering them, anticipating them through the aid of a radar detector, which comes standard in all vehicles in the game.",

Plok aforementioned to them about his grandfather who gave him a warning about the Bobbins and decided to fight the two for the large flag. \n \nAfter vanquishing the Bobbins Brothers and getting his big square flag back, Plok sails his way back to Akrillic until the next day, out of the blue, he find that the island has been infested and over taken by fleas with various of eggs, an annoying medium-sized two-legged blue insects that frequently hops around. He quickly learned that the theft of his large flag was simply a decoy to lure him away from Akrillic and leave him unguarded due to his obsessions with flags. Plok must travel throughout Akrillic, getting rid of every single flea on the surface in order to reclaim his island at peace. Partway through the game, at the outside of his home, Plok places the big square flag back right where it belongs and then takes a break as he sits on a foot of the statue of his grandfather Grandpappy Plok, hoping there is a useful item that will help him to deal with the fleas. He took a nap and having an odd dream of his grandfather\u0027s search for a amulet 50 years ago. \n \nSailing across from his home and onward to Legacy Island, Grandpappy shares the same experience of what his grandson has to in the present: traveling through bizarre obstacles, discovering wrong artifacts like a vase, and dealing with two same Bobbin Brothers, but that with their third brother Irving. After him defeating the Bobbin Brothers, Grandpappy finally dug up an amulet and sail back to his home at Akrillic victoriously. Back to the present day, Plok woke up from a dream and discovers that the amulet is located at the bottom of the statue. Plok\u0027s mission on getting his island back continues with an ability where he can turn himself into a saw. \n \nPlok then heads into various of locations around the island while facing other creatures who also have an intention to take over the island as well: the magicians Penkinos, a large spider Womack, and a huge humanoid rock creature Rockyfella. After confronting them as he clearing out all the fleas from Akrillic and rising the flags, Plok descends into Brendammi Bog where the source of all the bizarre (yet aggressive) fleas is located, the Fleapit. There, Plok notices various presents waiting for him as he rides on various vehicles with different kinds of arsenals. Plok journeys deep down into the Fleapit, and ultimately challenging a large insect who is responsible for hatching all the fleas around his island and a ruler of the same kind, the Flea Queen. Plok eventually vanquished her with a bug spray and went back home for a well-deserved sleep on a green chair, thus saving the day.",

    "summary": "As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance.\n\nBoth players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.\n\nT2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.\n\nAssets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).",
